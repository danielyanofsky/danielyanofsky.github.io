## Spoon Stabilizer for Hand Tremors

**Project description:** To cope with the symptoms Parkinson's patients struggle with daily, a mechatronics solution was 3D printed that utilizes components including an IMU sensor, servo motor, and a microcontroller to swiftly stabilize a spoon. A complementary filter is used to combine the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from the IMU sensor to understand the angular position, orientation, and velocity of the spoon. Through a push-pull linkage, the solution stabilizes the spoon in the pitch and roll axis actuated by the servo motor.
