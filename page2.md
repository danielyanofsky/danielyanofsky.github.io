## Thermal Diode Development - Final Design Project

**Project description:** 
Inspired by the electric diode, where modern electronics have been revolutionized, our goal was to develop a process where the control of heat transfer like an electric diode controls the flow of electrons. Moreover, an effective thermal diode would be able to restrict and support the direction of heat flow. Our group performed an extensive literature review on current technology and simulated the heat transfer in specific materials, geometries, and other variables calculating the difference of heat flow transfer in the forward and reverse directions. We analyzed the literature and gathered data with numerical analysis with the aid of simulation and 3D design. The larger a heat transfer is in the forward direction relative to the reverse translates to a more effective diode. Conducting simulation, environmental, manufacturing, and economic analysis, two phase-change materials and shape of the device were proposed for an effective diode.
