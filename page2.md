## Thermal Diode Development - Final Design Project

**Project description:** 
Analogous to how electric diodes have revolutionized electronics with the ability to control the direction of current, an effective thermal diode would be able to restrict and support the direction of heat flow. Our group performed an extensive literature review on current technology and simulated the heat transfer in specific materials and geometries calculating the difference of heat flow transfer in the forward and reverse directions. The larger a heat transfer is in the forward direction relative to the reverse translates to a more effective diode. Conducting simulation, environmental, manufacturing, and economic analysis, two phase-change materials and shape of the device were proposed for an effective diode
