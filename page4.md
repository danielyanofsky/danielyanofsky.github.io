## Autonomous Omni-Directional Robot

**Project description:** Designed, manufactured, and programmed a robot that could move quickly through a maze with the ability to move in all directions carefully avoiding obstacles. Although the final design was not tested due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the design operated in a closed loop system with 4 DC motors, 4 rotary encoders, 2 H-bridge ICs, and an Arduino controller. Aluminum parts were machined for a two-tier design and motor mounts.
